### Team Members:
- Karthik Reddy Pagilla

### Instructions:
- Use the `make` command to compile the code
- This would create an executable called `sleepingStylistSem`
- Use `./sleepingStylistSem` command to run the executable
- This would generate the output on the command line

**Optional**

- Use `./sleepingStylistSem > sleepingStylistSemOuput.out` to run the executable
- This would generate the output in an output file called `sleepingStylistSemOuput.out`

### Observations:
- The output contains which customers are being put into the waiting queue
- The output contains which customer is being served
- The output contains which customer is getting a haircut
- The output contains which customer left when the shop is full
- The output contains which customer reattempts to enter the shop
- The output contains total customers served
- The output contains total customers waiting
- The output contains number of times the salon was full
- The output contains number of times the salon was empty

### Note:
- The output might be very long as the debug statements print all the customers who leave and reattempt for a haircut.
- To shorten the output please comment out `line 118` and `line 122`.
